# PyTorch Geometric core library (usually installed via conda or pip with extras)

torch-geometric

# Required PyG backend libraries (usually installed via conda or pip with extras)
# Example pip install command (adjust versions for your torch/cuda):
# pip install pyg-lib torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.4.1+cu121.html

pyg-lib

# Data Handling and Processing

pandas
numpy
ijson  # For large JSON parsing
scikit-learn # For metrics (roc_auc_score, average_precision_score)

# Model Loading and Utilities

transformers # For SciBERT/AutoModel
safetensors # For secure model loading
tqdm # Progress bars

# Dataset Download

kaggle # For downloading the dataset via API

# Note: Specific versions are omitted as they depend heavily on the conda solver's resolution based on your CUDA version and PyTorch requirements.
# It's recommended to create the environment using the conda commands provided in the conversation history for best compatibility.
